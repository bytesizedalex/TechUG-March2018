TechnologyUG Presentation - March 2018

The URLs and attached documents were presented at the Technology User Group (TechUG) conference in Manchester on 22nd March 2018. I have included them here for reference and ease of access.

This information is also available on my blog -  https://www.bytesizedalex.com/techug-march-2018/

It shouled be noted that the slides are used as talking points and do not encompass the full discussion nor the live demo material conducted on my home lab.

While I am happy for people to reference the material I would be grateful if any copies reference this repository or my blog.
